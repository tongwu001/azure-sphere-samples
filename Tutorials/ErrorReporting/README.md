# Tutorials: Error Reporting

The goal of this tutorial is to demonstrate how to use the Azure Sphere error reporting feature to analyze errors and events reported when the application crashes or exits successfully.

To achieve this, the tutorial is presented in two stages:  

 * [Stage 1](Stage1/) - provides an implementation of an application that crashes.
 * [Stage 2](Stage2/) - provides the correct implementation of the application.
